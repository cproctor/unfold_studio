Welcome to Unfold Studio
########################

`Unfold Studio`_ is an online community for interactive storytelling powered by
a programming language called Ink. Interactive storytelling brings together the 
power of programming with the ability of stories to represent and explore our 
lived realities. Unfold Studio is free and open-source. 

Unfold Studio is used in schools, clubs, and by many individual writers. Interactive 
storytelling can be a way to integrate Computer Science into English, Social Studies, or other
subjects. It can also be an excellent way to introduce Computer Science as a subject relevant to 
questions of identity, culture, and social justice. (We are currently doing research with a school 
which uses Unfold Studio for several months as part of its core CS curriculum.)

This documentation is meant for several audiences. If you need help using Unfold Studio
or writing interactive stories, see the :ref:`user_guide`. (If you're impatient, try the
:ref:`quickstart`.) If you are interested in using 
Unfold Studio with students, see :ref:`teaching`. And if you're interested in Unfold Studio's 
back story or research on transliteracies, CS education, etc. please see :ref:`research`.
We welcome questions, feedback, and random ideas. Please see :ref:`contact` to get in touch.
