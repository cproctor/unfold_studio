Unfold Studio is under active development! You're welcome to contribute new ideas or report bugs on the `Github issues page`_. Some of our top priorities:

.. _Github issues page: https://github.com/cproctor/unfold_studio/issues

- A full rewrite of the user interface
- The ability to add pictures and sounds to stories
- Internationalization (Unfold Studio's interface will show up in users' preferred language). Writing stories in multiple languages (and emoji!) is already supported and heartily encouraged.

0.5
===
Version 0.5 adds features that make it easier to teach with Unfold Studio. There are also new features designed 

- There is now a teacher role. Teachers can have groups of students. (Note: Currently, you can't sign up as a teacher on your own. Please see :ref:`contact` to get in touch.)
- Teachers can assign :ref:`prompts` to students. Students see prompts they are assigned, and can submit stories to them. Teachers can see and comment on stories submitted to prompts, even if they are not publicly shared. 
- Authors can save versions of stories (:ref:`story_versions`). This is helpful for the writing process, and for long serialized stories, where your followers might want to know there's an update available.
- Added :ref:`comments`. 
- In comments, book descriptions, and prompts, it's now possible to add :ref:`link_references` to stories, books, and users that stay up to date and are contextualized for different users.
- Private installations give teachers and schools access to separate worlds, where content is only visible to logged-in members. 
- Added internal support for single sign on integration
