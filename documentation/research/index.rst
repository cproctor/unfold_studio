Unfold Studio began as a research project during Chris Proctor's PhD at Stanford's Grauduate School of Education. 
As a former high school English teacher and a middle-school CS teacher, Chris was interested in how computer science 
might enrich the work of the humanities, and how a literacy-based approach to computer science could help make it more
inviting to all students.
