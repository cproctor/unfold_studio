Curriculum Unit
********************

This five-week curriculum unit provides an example of how `Unfold Studio`_ can be integrated into a secondary
English, Social Studies, or Computer Science course. You may want to use it whole, or mix and match lessons and 
resources to make it fit your discipline and teaching context. This unit is released free for noncommercial use. 
It was written by Chris Proctor, who would love to receive your questions and feedback. (see :ref:`contact`)

Introduction
============

**Who can we become?** The social worlds we live in provide both resources and limitations 
for the kinds of identities we can write for ourselves. We all know how great it feels
to be in a space where you can be your full self. We are also familiar with how some spaces
keep us from being the people we would like to be. 

This unit invites students to explore
the relationship between language, identity, and literacy spaces. Literacy spaces are communities
of meaning-making which have their own histories with certain ideas and ways of understanding. 
Your family is a literacy space--its members are known in particular ways, you know what gets talked
about (and what doesn't) at the dinner table, and everyone knows what to laugh about and what to 
take seriously. Other examples of literacy spaces are school classrooms and Facebook. 

In a typical US middle or high school, these questions would often be explored in an English, 
Language Arts, or Social Studies class. They might also be right at home in a Computer 
Science class. We are still developing an idea of what secondary Computer Science should look like, 
but these questions are of central importance to human-computer interaction, modeling social phenomena, 
and computational linguistics. This unit is an example of how `Unfold Studio`_ can support interdisciplinary 
literacies, using computational tools to explore humanistic questions. 

Objectives
==========

- Use the concepts of *identity*, *model of personhood*, *register*, and 
  *literacy space* to analyze real-world social experiences. 
- Write interactive stories which critically engage with real-world social experiences. 
- Plan interactive stories using planning and prewriting strategies such as 
  freewriting and using *graphs* to plan story flow. 
- Use *flow control* and *state* to write interactive stories. Specifically, make use of:

  - Branches (see :ref:`branching`)
  - Variables (see :ref:`variables`)
  - Advanced: Tunnels and Threads (see :ref:`advanced_flow_control`)
  - Advanced: Lists (see :ref:`advanced_state_tracking`)

Assessment
==========

Three assessments will allow students to demonstrate mastery of these objectives:

- The :ref:`prewriting_assessment` assesses students' prewriting and planning strategies. Students
  submit prewriting documents, a story draft, and a reflection explaining the prewriting documents.
- The :ref:`portfolio` assesses students' ability to analyze and critically engage with real-world
  social experiences. Students submit several stories and a reflection explaining their intent. 
- The :ref:`fairy_assessment` assesses students' ability to use programming concepts. Students are given a 
  broken story and asked to fix it. 

The writer's workshop structure provides plenty of opportunities for informal formative assessment.
The unit also contains several structured opportunities to check how students are doing.
