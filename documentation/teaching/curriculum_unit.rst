Curriculum Unit
********************

This five-week curriculum unit provides an example of how `Unfold Studio`_ can be integrated into a secondary
English, Social Studies, or Computer Science course. You may want to use it whole, or mix and match lessons and 
resources to make it fit your discipline and teaching context. This unit is released free for noncommercial use. 
It was written by Chris Proctor, who would love to receive your questions and feedback. (see :ref:`contact`)

.. note:: This curriculum unit follows the backwards-planning format suggested in *Understanding by Design* 
   :cite:`wiggins_temp`.
   The jumping-off point is an essential question, something worth thinking about for a long time and 
   which leads to important ideas. Pursuing the essential question provides opportunities for particular
   learning objectives and assessments to measure growth. 
   Once this planning is finished, we are ready to plan out the lesson day-by-day.

Introduction
============

**How do we build our worlds?** The social worlds we live in provide both resources and limitations for the kinds of identities we can write for ourselves. We all know how great it feels to be in a space where you feel safe and free. We are also familiar with how some spaces keep us from being the people we would like to be. Maybe it’s because your parents have a fixed idea about who you are, and impose that on you. Maybe it’s because you’re not around the people who know you best, and with whom you have shared memories. Maybe it’s because you’re in a culture that attaches expectations to your gender, race, or social position.

This unit invites students to explore the relationship between language, identity, and literacy spaces. Literacy spaces are communities of meaning-making which have their own histories with ideas and ways of understanding media. Your family is a literacy space–its members are known in particular ways, you know what gets talked about (and what doesn’t) at the dinner table, and everyone knows what to laugh about and what to take seriously. Other examples of literacy spaces are school classrooms and Facebook.

In a typical US middle or high school, these questions would often be explored in an English, Language Arts, or Social Studies class. They also ought to be right at home in a Computer Science class. We are still developing an idea of what secondary Computer Science should look like, but these questions are of central importance to human-computer interaction, modeling social phenomena, and computational linguistics. By opening a place for telling stories that matter to us, we will create a world where computational thinking is relevant and useful for the things we already care about. This unit is an example of how `Unfold Studio`_ can support interdisciplinary literacies, using computational tools to explore humanistic questions. 

Essential Questions
===================

- What worlds do we live in?
- Who can we be in those worlds? 
- How do we build our worlds?

Objectives
==========

1. Write interactive stories which critically engage with real-world social experiences.
2. Writing/programming practices: Reading, writing, revision, debugging, editing. 
3. Plan interactive stories using planning and prewriting strategies such as 
   freewriting and using *graphs* to plan story flow. 
4. Use *flow control* and *state* to write interactive stories. Specifically, make use of:

   - Branches (see :ref:`branching`)
   - Variables (see :ref:`variables`)
   - Advanced: Tunnels and Threads (see :ref:`advanced_flow_control`)
   - Advanced: Lists (see :ref:`advanced_state_tracking`)

Assessment
==========

Three assessments will allow students to demonstrate mastery of these objectives:

- The :ref:`portfolio` assesses students' ability to analyze and critically engage with real-world
  social experiences (Objectives 1 \& 2). Students submit several stories and a reflection explaining their intent. 
- The :ref:`fairy_assessment` assesses students' ability to use programming concepts (Objective 4). Students are 
  given a broken story and asked to fix it. 

The writer's workshop structure provides plenty of opportunities for informal formative assessment.
The unit also contains several structured opportunities to check how students are doing.
