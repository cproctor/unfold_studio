Assessments

Broken Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students are given a broken interactive story and asked to fix it. 
`Here is an example Broken Story assessment`_; you may use it as-is or adapt a version to fit 
your teaching context and the skills you want to assess.

This strategy for assessing computational 
thinking was developed by :cite:`werner_fairy_2012`. Creating a standardized assessment of computational 
thinking is tricky because a student's ability to demonstrate mastery depends on her mastery of the 
programming language being used. The Broken Story assessment is particularly
attractive for `Unfold Studio`_ because the assessment is much more like the practice of writing interactive
stories than something like a multiple-choice test. It is also possible to automatically assess Broken Stories, 
though this is not yet available.
