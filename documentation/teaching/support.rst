Support
*******************

If you have questions about teaching with `Unfold Studio`_ or using it for other
purposes, please get in touch with Chris Proctor (:ref:`contact`), the creator
and lead researcher on the project. He's happy to answer questions, or just
brainstorm some ideas together. 

The best place for technical questions, bug reports, and requested features is `Unfold Studio's GitHub site`_, 
but you're welcome to send them by email if that is more comfortable.

Private installations
=====================

Many teachers choose to use the free public version of `Unfold Studio`_ and value the authentic audience 
it provides. However, this might not be the right fit for all schools. Private installations are also 
available, where access is restricted to logged-in members. 
Private installations include a customized domain, user administration (eg. bulk-importing and setup; LMS and single sign-on integration), 
and technical support. 

Private installations are subscription-based. These fees help us keep Unfold Studio freely available and support ongoing 
development. If you are able to support Unfold Studio by signing up for a private installation, we really appreciate it. 

Professional development
========================

Chris, an award-winning teacher and `experienced provider of professional development`_, is available for customized 
PD with `Unfold Studio`_ on a range of scales. `Unfold Studio`_ can be a great introduction to Computer Science 
and a powerful way to incorporate computational thinking across the STEM disciplines, the social sciences, and the humanities.
