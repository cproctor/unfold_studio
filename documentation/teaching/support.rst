brainstorm some ideas together.

Professional Services
=====================

Many teachers choose to use the free public version of `Unfold Studio`_ and value the authentic audience 
it provides. However, this might not be the right fit for all schools. Private installations are also 
available, in which access is restricted to logged-in members and teachers have access to a dashboard
where they can view and administer stories. 

Chris, an award-winning teacher and `experienced provider of professional development`_, is available for customized 
PD with `Unfold Studio`_ on a range of scales. `Unfold Studio`_ can be a great introduction to Computer Science 
for students and teachers alike!
