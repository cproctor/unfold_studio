Quickstart
************

First time here? This will guide you through writing your first story.

Open `Unfold Studio`_ in a new tab. Click on **New Story** and then give your story a name.
Now copy the code below into your new story and save it. Now you can play it on the right. 

.. literalinclude:: ../stories/quickstart.ink
   :linenos:
   :language: text

This is interactive storytelling. You can write stories that are playable, 
not just readable. You can give the player as much control as you want. 

You probably guessed how the code works. ``*`` marks choices offered to the player. Each choice
has some text and then a divert (``->``), which sends the story off to another *knot*. Knots are
defined with headers that look like ``=== high_energy ===``. Use ``DONE`` to show where a story ends.
Try adding some choices to one of the knots. Maybe these choices should divert to a new knot...

Now, if you return to the homepage (click **Unfold Studio** in the menu), your story might be featured
because it's fresh content. (Stories also get featured when they have a lot of readers, or are loved 
by a lot of people.) Since you don't have an account yet, it's a public story. Anybody can play it and 
anybody can edit it. 

What's next...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Play some stories**. The homepage has featured stories; you can see the rest by clicking **Browse** in the menu. 
- **Practice writing more complex stories** with :ref:`story_prompts`.
- **Learn more about the language** at :ref:`ink`.
- **Sign up**. Once you have an account, you can create private stories and then share them once you're ready. You can 
  also ``<3`` stories you love, follow other users, collect stories into *books*, and more.

We hope you enjoy Unfold Studio!
