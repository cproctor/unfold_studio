User accounts
=============
You can participate in Unfold Studio without signing up.
Before you have an account, all the stories you write are public. This means anybody can play and edit them. You can also play public stories and stories other authors have shared. 

Public stories are good for quick experiments, but once you're ready to write stories that matter to you, you should
create an account. When you are logged in to your account, you are the author of your stories and nobody else can 
edit them.

Unfold Studio is free and open-source; signing up is safe and easy. You will be asked to give your email and choose 
a username and password. If you forget your password, you can have a reset code sent to your email address. 

.. note:: 

Writing

When you are logged in, your stories will be private until you choose to share them. Sharing a story makes it visible to everybody.

Community
