            This is a comment; it has no effect on the page. 
            We need to load some scripts:
                - jQuery is a very common library for using javascript to control a webpage. Look it up!
                - Backbone gives us a Model and a View. Models are useful for keeping track of what's 
                  happening in a game; views are useful for showing the information the model is storing.
                  This is a really common pattern; it will help keep things organized.
                - Underscore is a collection of a bunch of really useful functions. I use it in most 
                  of my projects.
                - jsGame is the game object I wrote. 
                - At the bottom of the page, we load demo.js, which creates a new game object and starts
                  it. (Need to load it at the bottom so that the page already exists when it starts.)
